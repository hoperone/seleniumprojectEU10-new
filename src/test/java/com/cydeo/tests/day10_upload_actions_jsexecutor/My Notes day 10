What is data driven testing?

Data-driven testing is a method of testing in which test cases are designed to use test data
and expected results from a data source, such as an Excel spreadsheet or a database.
The data source is used to drive the execution of the test cases, with the test script
reading the test data and expected results from the data source and then comparing the
actual results to the expected results. This allows for automated, repeatable testing
and can make it easier to maintain test cases, as changes to the
data source will automatically update the test cases.

What is design pattern in software development?

In software development, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a
commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished
design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template
for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
Design patterns are typically categorized as creational, structural,
and behavioral patterns. They can help to make code more readable, maintainable, and reusable.
